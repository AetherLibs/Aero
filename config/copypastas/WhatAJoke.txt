Haha what a joke the hell is wrong with you people. Why why why why . I'm a great person, I'm amazing, and nice and cute so why why is everyone such a shit friend. If I was someone else I would sure want a friend like me. Ty Won't even pick up the phone when I call, and avoid me at all costs. Isolate me. Never replying. And even people who i met online and thought i knew like you. You can't forgive one little mishap. Even though I've always been a Good friend before that. What a joke. Were we even friends to start with. The hell's wrong with you
