Look out for a Discord user by the name of "swooperscooper" with the tag #6216. He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim aswell. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. Our team is currently working very hard to remove this user from our database, please stay safe.
