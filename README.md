# Aero

An intuitive Discord bot perfect for your server

## About

Aero is a project centered around two things that we've seen being poorly done in other bots time after time:
- moderation
- user engagement

Our goal is to make advanced moderation and anti-raid as intuitive and easy to use as possible, while not missing out on any features other bots have.  
If you're currently using a bot like Dyno, Carl, Mee6, or any of the major multiuse bots, there's a high chance that Aero can fully replace them, while more effectively protecting you and your members from raids, spam, or just known baddies.


## Services and tools we use and appreciate

On its own, Aero is pretty cool. But there's some tools we use to extend this even further. Those are:
- [The KSoft.Si API](https://api.ksoft.si) - A swiss-army-knife for images, a huge yet transparent global ban list, and a lot of utilities
- [ChatWatch](https://chatwat.ch) - A joint effort between the teams at Aero and KSoft.Si to prevent spam
- [DiscordRep](https://discordrep.com) - An online fraud prevention project

Aero isn't built from scratch, there's a few libraries that we used to build Aero. The most important are:
- [Klasa](https://klasa.js.org) - An object-oriented framework around discord.js which saves us from writing all the basics
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) - A powerful and easy to use wrapper around the Discord API
- [centra](https://github.com/ethanent/centra) - A powerful wrapper around http.request with a beautiful syntax
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A general purpose, document-based, distributed NoSQL database


## Selfhosting and other license stuff
